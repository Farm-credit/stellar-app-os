# Next Steps

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are not automatically generated, but they are a useful way to keep track of where you are in the project. You can use them to navigate back to previous sections or to jump to specific sections.

To enable breadcrumbs, you need to run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run generate-breadcrumbs
```

You will need to run this command every time you add a new page or change the structure of your pages. This will ensure that your breadcrumbs are up to date and reflect the current structure of your project.
